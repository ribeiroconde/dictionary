It gives you a wizard for defining a table schema, then generates and updates the matching:

- Eloquent model
- migration
- factory
- seeder
- Filament resource and page classes

The current implementation is built for iterative work, not just first-time scaffolding. Existing blueprints can be created, merged, or replaced depending on the selected generation mode.

## Quick Start

> Prerequisite: you already have a Laravel app with a Filament panel set up.

> Upgrading from a pre-1.0.0 release? Skip to the [Upgrade](#upgrading-from-pre-100) section, or review [`UPGRADE.md`](UPGRADE.md).

1. Install the package.
2. Run the Dictionary installer.
3. Register the plugin in your Filament panel.
4. Open the **Dictionary** action in your panel and generate your first resource stack.

```bash
composer require ribeiroconde/filament-dictionary
php artisan dictionary:install
```

```php
use ribeiroconde\Dictionary\DictionaryPlugin;

->plugins([
    DictionaryPlugin::make(),
])
```

---

## Highlights

### Wizard-driven scaffolding inside Filament
- Multi-step wizard with database, Eloquent, and review steps
- Live previews for:
  - migration
  - model
  - factory
  - seeder
  - Filament resource
- Existing blueprints can be listed, loaded back into the wizard, and deleted

### Generates the full stack around a model
Dictionary can generate:
- Eloquent models
- create migrations
- sync/update migrations for existing tables
- model factories
- seeders
- Filament resources
- Filament `List`, `Create`, `Edit`, and `View` pages

### Three generation modes
When files already exist, you can choose how Dictionary behaves:

- `create` — only create missing blueprints
- `merge` — refresh managed/generated sections while preserving custom code where possible
- `replace` — rewrite generated blueprints and unlock destructive rebuild workflows

`merge` is the default and the safest mode for day-to-day iteration.

### Merge-aware updates for existing code
The plugin now updates existing generated files instead of blindly overwriting them.

For models, factories, and Filament resources, the merge flow is parser-aware and uses `nikic/php-parser` to preserve custom code while refreshing generated structure. Seeders use a managed generated-region strategy.

Current merge support includes:

- **Model**
  - merges missing imports
  - merges traits like `HasFactory`, `SoftDeletes`, `HasUuids`, `HasUlids`
  - updates `$fillable`
  - adds inferred `belongsTo` relationships for foreign-key-like columns
  - preserves existing custom methods

- **Factory**
  - merges missing `definition()` keys
  - preserves existing custom values
  - preserves custom methods/state helpers

- **Seeder**
  - merges only the managed generated seeding region
  - preserves custom logic outside that region
  - hides managed markers from preview output

- **Filament Resource**
  - **v3 (monolithic):** merges generated `form()`, `table()`, and `infolist()` sections; preserves custom entries; keeps missing page classes
  - **v4 (domain):** merges each schema/table file independently (`*Form.php`, `*Infolist.php`, `*Table.php`); thin resource only syncs imports and `getEloquentQuery()`
  - removes stale managed fields when columns are removed from the blueprint
  - preserves existing page classes; creates missing ones

### Revision-aware migration previews and sync generation
Dictionary stores blueprint revisions after successful generation.

That revision history is used to make migration previews and sync migrations smarter:

- migration preview compares the current blueprint against the **latest generated revision**, not only the live database state
- sync migration generation follows the same revision-aware diff baseline
- this avoids re-showing or re-generating fields that belonged to a previous revision but were not yet applied in the database

### Safer schema evolution
Dictionary supports guarded schema changes for existing tables:

- additive sync migrations for new columns
- column type / nullable / default / index / unique changes
- likely rename detection
- destructive change gating for removed columns
- soft delete add/remove handling
- optional immediate migration execution
- automatic warning/defer behavior when risky schema operations are not explicitly allowed

### Better generated-file readability
When enabled, Dictionary will try to run a formatter after writing generated files.

It also normalizes merged output for several blueprint types so updated files stay readable, including:
- multiline resource arrays and fluent chains
- spacing between class members in models and factories
- multiline factory `definition()` arrays

### Filament panel integration
- Works with **Filament 4 and 5** (legacy `v3` flat structure also supported via `DICTIONARY_FILAMENT_VERSION=v3`)
- Generates resources in the correct structure for your Filament version (`v4`/`v5` domain by default, `v3` flat as legacy) — controlled by `DICTIONARY_FILAMENT_VERSION`
- Registers as a global panel action through the plugin
- Can render as a normal button or icon button
- Supports these render hooks:
  - `PanelsRenderHook::GLOBAL_SEARCH_BEFORE`
  - `PanelsRenderHook::GLOBAL_SEARCH_AFTER`
  - `PanelsRenderHook::USER_MENU_AFTER`

### Production-aware visibility
The Dictionary action is hidden in production by default unless explicitly enabled.

### Extension points for Premium / third-party packages
Dictionary Core now exposes a small set of stable extension points so premium modules or internal packages can build on the OSS workflow without forking the generators.

- **Capability resolver**
  - resolve named capabilities such as `premium.blocks` or `premium.revisions.browser`
  - defaults to a safe false-y resolver until another package defines a capability

- **Block registry**
  - merge additional block definitions into an existing block list while preserving base ordering
  - useful for premium-only content blocks or internal blueprint presets

- **UI extension registry**
  - register additional Dictionary tabs
  - append create/edit schema fragments
  - append existing-resource fragments

- **Post-generation hooks**
  - run logic after a blueprint is generated and its revision is recorded
  - useful for audit trails, premium revision tooling, or project-specific follow-up automation

- **Versioned revision snapshots**
  - blueprint revisions now expose a versioned snapshot payload plus metadata
  - gives future diff / restore tooling a stable contract to build on

Minimal access example:

```php
use ribeiroconde\Dictionary\DictionaryPlugin;

DictionaryPlugin::capabilities()->define('premium.blocks', true);

DictionaryPlugin::blocks()->register([
    'type' => 'premium-carousel',
    'label' => 'Premium Carousel',
]);

DictionaryPlugin::generationHooks()->afterGenerate(
    function ($blueprint, $blueprintData, $plan, bool $shouldRunMigration): void {
        // custom follow-up logic
    }
);
```

## Planned premium edition

Dictionary today is focused on strong open-source CRUD scaffolding and safe regeneration loops.

A premium edition — **Dictionary PRO** — builds on that foundation with workflows especially useful for larger teams, legacy projects, and more complex data models.

### Available in Dictionary PRO

These features are already shipped in the premium package:

- **Visual revision history**
  - browse stored blueprint revisions
  - GitHub-style diff view of changes between snapshots

- **Blueprint comments / notes**
  - annotate blueprints with inline notes
  - basic team communication around blueprint changes

- **Blueprint approval workflows**
  - request and track approval for blueprint changes
  - basic review flow (full team mode in development)

- **Audit log browser**
  - inspect a searchable log of blueprint-related activity

### Coming soon

These features are planned for future PRO releases:

- **Rollback / restore workflows**
  - one-click restore of a previous blueprint revision
  - streamline reverting generated files and related schema changes

- **Legacy adoption / reverse engineering**
  - import existing models, tables, and resources into Dictionary
  - generate an editable blueprint from an existing Laravel project

- **Advanced relationship tooling**
  - many-to-many and pivot-table support
  - polymorphic relationship support
  - richer Filament relationship generation flows

- **Full team collaboration**
  - blueprint locks and ownership
  - broader audit trails and collaboration tooling (approvals and comments are available now)

- **Priority support**
  - commercial support for teams that want faster feedback and help

> Some PRO features are already available; others are still in development. The open-source package described in this README is the free, currently available product.

### Waiting list / early-bird pricing

Before the premium edition launches, a waiting list is planned.

The idea is to offer **early-bird launch pricing** to people who join that waiting list before release.

Until pricing and packaging are finalized, it is safest to describe this as:

- planned early-access / waiting-list announcement
- likely early-bird pricing for pre-launch signups
- final details to be confirmed at launch

[Join the waiting list](https://filamentcomponents.com/wailtlist/dictionary?source=github)

## Requirements

- PHP `^8.3`
- Filament `^4.0|^5.0`

---

## Installation

### Fresh install

```bash
composer require ribeiroconde/filament-dictionary
php artisan dictionary:install
```

Then register the plugin in your Filament panel provider:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers\Filament;

use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\PanelProvider;
use ribeiroconde\Dictionary\DictionaryPlugin;

class AdminPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
            ->plugins([
                DictionaryPlugin::make(),
            ]);
    }
}
```

`dictionary:install` publishes assets and migrations, runs `php artisan migrate`, and registers a Composer hook for `filament:assets`.

### Upgrading from pre-1.0.0

If you are upgrading from any pre-1.0.0 release (`v0.2.x`, `v0.1.x`, etc.):

```bash
composer require ribeiroconde/filament-dictionary:^1.0
php artisan dictionary:upgrade
```

`dictionary:upgrade` publishes the new migrations, runs `php artisan migrate`, and backfills initial revisions for existing blueprints.

> **Tip:** Run `php artisan dictionary:upgrade --dry-run` first to preview which blueprints will be backfilled without writing any changes.

For a detailed walkthrough, see [`UPGRADE.md`](UPGRADE.md).

---

## Add the plugin to a Filament panel

Register the plugin in your panel provider:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers\Filament;

use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\PanelProvider;
use ribeiroconde\Dictionary\DictionaryPlugin;

class AdminPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
            ->plugins([
                DictionaryPlugin::make(),
            ]);
    }
}
```

Optional plugin customization:

```php
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;
use ribeiroconde\Dictionary\DictionaryPlugin;

DictionaryPlugin::make()
    ->iconButton()
    ->renderHook(PanelsRenderHook::USER_MENU_AFTER);
```

---

## Configuration

Dictionary uses sensible runtime fallbacks, but the available options are defined in `config/dictionary.php`.

Key options include:

- `show`
- `generate_factory`
- `generate_seeder`
- `generate_resource`
- `default_generation_mode`
- `format_generated_files`
- `formatter`
- `models_namespace`
- `factories_namespace`
- `seeders_namespace`
- `resources_namespace`
- `filament_version`

Example configuration:

```php
return [
    'show' => env('DICTIONARY_SHOW', false),
    'generate_factory' => env('DICTIONARY_GENERATE_FACTORY', true),
    'generate_seeder' => env('DICTIONARY_GENERATE_SEEDER', true),
    'generate_resource' => env('DICTIONARY_GENERATE_RESOURCE', true),
    'default_generation_mode' => env('DICTIONARY_DEFAULT_GENERATION_MODE', 'merge'),
    'format_generated_files' => env('DICTIONARY_FORMAT_GENERATED_FILES', true),
    'formatter' => env('DICTIONARY_FORMATTER', 'pint_if_available'),
    'models_namespace' => env('DICTIONARY_MODELS_NAMESPACE', 'App\\Models'),
    'factories_namespace' => env('DICTIONARY_FACTORIES_NAMESPACE', 'Database\\Factories'),
    'seeders_namespace' => env('DICTIONARY_SEEDERS_NAMESPACE', 'Database\\Seeders'),
    'resources_namespace' => env('DICTIONARY_RESOURCES_NAMESPACE', 'App\\Filament\\Resources'),
    'filament_version' => env('DICTIONARY_FILAMENT_VERSION', 'v4'),
];
```

Useful environment variables:

```env
DICTIONARY_SHOW=true
DICTIONARY_GENERATE_FACTORY=true
DICTIONARY_GENERATE_SEEDER=true
DICTIONARY_GENERATE_RESOURCE=true
DICTIONARY_DEFAULT_GENERATION_MODE=merge
DICTIONARY_FORMAT_GENERATED_FILES=true
DICTIONARY_FORMATTER=pint_if_available
DICTIONARY_MODELS_NAMESPACE=App\Models
DICTIONARY_FACTORIES_NAMESPACE=Database\Factories
DICTIONARY_SEEDERS_NAMESPACE=Database\Seeders
DICTIONARY_RESOURCES_NAMESPACE=App\Filament\Resources
DICTIONARY_FILAMENT_VERSION=v4
```

### Filament version

Dictionary supports two resource output structures depending on your installed Filament version.

Set `DICTIONARY_FILAMENT_VERSION` in your `.env` file:

| Value | Target | Structure |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `v4` (default) | Filament 4 / 5 | Domain folder per model (`Resources/Users/`) with separate `Schemas/` and `Tables/` sub-classes |
| `v3` | Filament 3 | Flat structure (`Resources/UserResource.php`) with inline form, table and infolist |

```env
# Filament 4 or 5 (default)
DICTIONARY_FILAMENT_VERSION=v4

# Filament 3
DICTIONARY_FILAMENT_VERSION=v3
```

### Formatting options
Supported formatter values:

- `pint_if_available` — run Pint only when a local binary exists
- `pint` — try to run Pint from the local project
- `none` — disable formatter execution

---

## Wizard workflow

### 1. Database step
You define the table structure:

- table name
- primary key type: `id`, `uuid`, or `ulid`
- soft deletes
- columns
- optional overwrite toggle in `replace` mode when the table already exists

Supported column types in the wizard:

- `string`
- `text`
- `integer`
- `unsignedBigInteger`
- `boolean`
- `json`
- `date`
- `dateTime`
- `foreignId`
- `foreignUuid`
- `foreignUlid`

Per-column options:
- default value
- nullable
- unique
- index
- drag-and-drop ordering

For foreign-key-like columns, you can also provide:
- optional related table metadata
- an optional relationship title column to improve generated Filament relationship fields

### 2. Eloquent step
You choose:

- model name
- generation mode
- whether to generate:
  - factory
  - seeder
  - Filament resource

### 3. Review step
You can:

- preview generated code
- choose whether to run migrations immediately
- allow likely renames
- allow destructive schema changes

Current code previews include:
- migration
- model
- factory
- seeder
- Filament resource

---

## Blueprint management

Dictionary stores blueprints in the database so you can iterate over time.

Current blueprint management features:
- list saved blueprints in the “Blueprints” tab
- load a blueprint back into the wizard
- save updated blueprint state when generating
- delete blueprints
- store blueprint revisions after successful generation

Blueprint revisions are used to improve migration preview and sync generation accuracy across multiple iterations.

> Current behavior: deleting a blueprint from the table is destructive. It also drops the related database table (if present), removes matching migration records, deletes generated files, and removes generated Filament resource pages.

---

## Generated blueprints

### Model
Location depends on `models_namespace`.

Generated behavior includes:
- `$fillable` from defined columns
- `HasFactory`
- `SoftDeletes` / `HasUuids` / `HasUlids` when applicable
- inferred `belongsTo` relationships for foreign-key-like columns

Relationship inference currently supports columns such as:
- `user_id`
- `author_uuid`
- `category_ulid`

### Migration
Dictionary can generate:
- create migrations for new tables
- sync migrations for existing tables
- revision-aware migration previews
- revision-aware sync generation for existing blueprints

### Factory
Location depends on `factories_namespace`.

Generated definitions are inferred from column names and types, including special handling for:
- email-like fields
- passwords/secrets
- content/body/description fields
- dates, booleans, numeric fields
- foreign-key-like columns (model factory references)

### Seeder
Location depends on `seeders_namespace`.

Generated seeders use a managed region strategy so repeated generations can refresh the generated seeding block without wiping custom logic outside it.

### Filament Resource
Location depends on `resources_namespace` and `filament_version`.

Generated resource support includes:
- resource class
- list page
- create page
- edit page
- view page
- form schema generation
- table column generation
- infolist generation
- soft delete filters and bulk actions
- generated relationship fields for foreign-key-like columns
- optional relationship title-column metadata for generated Filament relationship selects and table columns

#### v4 / v5 — domain structure (default)

Dictionary generates a **thin resource** that delegates to dedicated schema and table classes.

```
app/Filament/Resources/
└── Users/                          # domain folder = Str::pluralStudly(model)
    ├── UserResource.php             # thin — delegates to Form / Infolist / Table classes
    ├── Pages/
    │   ├── CreateUser.php
    │   ├── EditUser.php
    │   ├── ListUsers.php
    │   └── ViewUser.php
    ├── Schemas/
    │   ├── UserForm.php             # form()->components([...])
    │   └── UserInfolist.php         # infolist()->components([...])
    └── Tables/
        └── UsersTable.php           # table()->columns([...])
```

In `merge` mode each file is updated independently: form fields merge into `UserForm.php`, table columns into `UsersTable.php`, and the thin `UserResource.php` only receives new imports and the `getEloquentQuery()` method if needed.

#### v3 — flat / monolithic structure

Dictionary generates a single **monolithic resource** with form, infolist, and table defined inline, matching the classic Filament v3 layout.

```
app/Filament/Resources/
├── UserResource.php                 # form(), infolist(), table() all inline
└── UserResource/
    └── Pages/
        ├── CreateUser.php
        ├── EditUser.php
        ├── ListUsers.php
        └── ViewUser.php
```

To use v3 output, add `DICTIONARY_FILAMENT_VERSION=v3` to your `.env`.

---

## Schema safety and migration behavior

When working against existing tables, Dictionary supports a safer regeneration workflow.

### Supported diff types
- add columns
- change column type / nullable / default
- add or remove index / unique state
- detect likely renames
- remove columns when explicitly allowed
- add/remove soft deletes

### Safety controls
- **Likely renames** are opt-in
- **Destructive changes** are opt-in
- immediate migration execution is blocked when deferred risky operations are still present
- warning notifications are shown when migration execution is deferred for safety

### Revision-aware behavior
If a blueprint has prior revisions, Dictionary compares against the latest generated revision first.

This means:
- preview shows only the newest diff
- generated sync migrations also use that latest revision diff
- stale database state does not cause already-generated fields to be re-added in previews or sync migrations

---

## Merge behavior summary

| Blueprint | Managed / generated updates in `merge` mode | Preserved in `merge` mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model | Missing imports, framework traits, `$fillable`, inferred `belongsTo` relationships | Existing custom methods and existing relationship overrides |
| Factory | Missing `definition()` keys and generated imports | Existing custom field values and custom state/helper methods |
| Seeder | Managed generated block inside `run()` | Custom logic outside the managed seed region |
| Filament Resource (v3) | Managed `form()`, `table()`, `infolist()`, generated filters / bulk actions, missing page wiring | Clearly custom unmatched entries where possible, existing page classes |
| Filament Resource (v4) | Thin resource: new imports + `getEloquentQuery()` if missing; `*Form.php`, `*Infolist.php`, `*Table.php` each merged independently | Custom components in each schema/table file; custom page classes |
| Resource Pages | Missing generated page classes | Existing page classes and their custom logic |
| Migration Preview / Sync | Revision-aware diffing from the latest stored blueprint revision | Previous revisions stay as the baseline instead of being re-added from stale DB state |

### Notes

- `merge` mode is intended to refresh generated structure without flattening the whole file.
- Destructive schema operations and likely renames are still gated by explicit confirmation.
- `replace` mode is the option to use when you intentionally want Dictionary to rewrite generated blueprints.

---

## Plugin visibility and rendering

Dictionary is hidden in production by default.

To explicitly enable it:

```env
DICTIONARY_SHOW=true
```

Render hook and icon button options are configured through `DictionaryPlugin`:

```php
DictionaryPlugin::make()
    ->iconButton(true)
    ->renderHook(\Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook::GLOBAL_SEARCH_BEFORE);
```

---

#### Action Color

Customize the color of the Dictionary action button or icon button:

```php
DictionaryPlugin::make()
    ->actionColor('success')
```

When no custom color is provided, the action keeps Filament's default `primary` color.

#### Custom Render Hook

Change where the Dictionary action is rendered in your panel:

```php
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;

DictionaryPlugin::make()
    ->renderHook(PanelsRenderHook::GLOBAL_SEARCH_BEFORE)
```

By default, the action is rendered at `PanelsRenderHook::GLOBAL_SEARCH_BEFORE` when the panel topbar is enabled, and at `PanelsRenderHook::SIDEBAR_NAV_END` when the panel uses `->topbar(false)`.

Available render hooks:
- `PanelsRenderHook::GLOBAL_SEARCH_BEFORE` (default when the topbar is enabled)
- `PanelsRenderHook::GLOBAL_SEARCH_AFTER`
- `PanelsRenderHook::USER_MENU_AFTER`
- `PanelsRenderHook::SIDEBAR_NAV_START`
- `PanelsRenderHook::SIDEBAR_NAV_END` (default when the topbar is hidden)
- `PanelsRenderHook::SIDEBAR_FOOTER`

## Usage

### Accessing the Wizard

Once installed and configured, the Dictionary plugin adds an action button to your Filament panel. Click the "Dictionary" button to open the generation wizard.

### Step 1: Database Configuration

Define your database table structure:

- **Table Name**: The name of your database table
- **Model Name**: The name of your Eloquent model class
- **Primary Key Type**: Choose between `id` (default), `uuid`, or `ulid`
- **Soft Deletes**: Enable soft delete support for your model

Configure what to generate:

- **Columns**: Define table columns with:
  - Column name
  - Data type (string, integer, boolean, datetime, text, etc.)
  - Nullable option
  - Default values
  - Indexing options

### Step 2: Eloquent Configuration

- **Model Name**: Automatically generated from table name (e.g., `projects` → `Project`)

- **Generation Options** (configurable via `config/dictionary.php`):
  - `gen_factory`: Generate model factory (default: true)
  - `gen_seeder`: Generate database seeder (default: true)
  - `gen_resource`: Generate Filament resource with CRUD pages (default: true)

**Note**: Migrations and Models are always generated as they are core to the plugin's functionality.

### Step 3: Review & Generate

Review your configuration and click "Save & Generate" to:

1. Save the blueprint to the database
2. Generate all selected files
3. Optionally run migrations immediately
4. Create Filament resource pages (list, create, edit, view)

### Managing Blueprints

In the "Blueprints" tab, you can:

- **View** all previously created blueprints
- **Edit** and regenerate any blueprint (coming soon)
- **Delete** blueprints

## Generated Files

When you use the Dictionary wizard, it generates the following files:

### Model
- Location: `app/Models/{ModelName}.php`
- Includes configured columns and relationships

### Migration
- Location: `database/migrations/{timestamp}_create_{table_name}_table.php`
- Creates table with all specified columns

### Factory
- Location: `database/factories/{ModelName}Factory.php`
- Includes factory definitions for all columns

### Seeder
- Location: `database/seeders/{ModelName}Seeder.php`
- Seedable template with model factory integration

### Filament Resource

Output structure depends on `DICTIONARY_FILAMENT_VERSION` (default: `v4`).

**v4 / v5 — domain structure:**
- **Resource class**: `app/Filament/Resources/{Models}/` (e.g. `Resources/Users/UserResource.php`)
- **Form schema**: `Schemas/{Model}Form.php`
- **Infolist schema**: `Schemas/{Model}Infolist.php`
- **Table**: `Tables/{Models}Table.php`
- **Pages**: `Pages/List{Models}.php`, `Create{Model}.php`, `Edit{Model}.php`, `View{Model}.php`

**v3 — flat / monolithic:**
- **Resource class**: `app/Filament/Resources/{Model}Resource.php`
- **Pages**: `{Model}Resource/Pages/List{Models}.php`, etc.


## Development

Run tests:

```bash
composer test
```

Format code:

---

## Current scope

Dictionary currently focuses on fast CRUD scaffolding and safe regeneration loops for Laravel + Filament projects.

The strongest supported workflows today are:
- initial scaffolding of a resource stack
- repeated blueprint-driven updates in `merge` mode
- revision-aware migration preview and sync generation
- preserving hand-written custom code around managed generated sections

Planned premium work is aimed at visual revision tooling, rollback workflows, legacy-project adoption, advanced relationships, and team-oriented collaboration features.
